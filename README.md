# 🚀 Day 76 — GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🧮 Problem: Implement Power Function (pow(x, n))
### 📌 Problem Statement:
## Design an efficient function to compute the value of b^e, where:

b is a floating-point base

e is an integer exponent
Handle both positive and negative exponents, including edge cases like b = 0, e = 0, and e < 0.

## 🧠 Approach:
✅ Implemented the Fast Exponentiation (Binary Exponentiation) method.
✅ Time complexity reduced to O(log e) instead of O(e).
✅ Handled negative exponents by converting the problem into its reciprocal form.

## 💡 Optimization Highlights:
Repeated squaring method enables performance boosts for large powers.

Edge case e == 0 returns 1.0 instantly.

Clean, iterative logic without recursion.

## 📊 Performance Snapshot:
Test Cases Passed: 1115 / 1115

Accuracy: 100%

Points Earned: 4 / 4

Time Taken: 0.03 sec ⚡

## 💬 Takeaway:
A foundational problem that blends math, logic, and bit manipulation into a highly optimized solution.
Understanding this prepares you for real-world systems that rely on exponentiation for cryptography, graphics, and simulations.
